[Pi](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi) session multiplexer. Run multiple Pi sessions in one terminal via `tmux`. Switch between them without killing the one you're leaving.

## Install

```bash
pi install npm:pi-mux
```

Requires tmux 3.0+ and pi ≥ 0.74.0. Run Pi inside any `tmux` session. Outside `tmux`, `pi-mux` is a no-op.

## Commands

### `/switch`

Pick a session and jump to it. Whatever you were in stays alive in the background. (Unlike `/resume`, which closes it.)

- Press **Tab** to toggle between **Current Folder** and **All** sessions (across folders).
- A spinner marks sessions currently working.
- If you switch to a session from another folder, pi-mux starts it in that session's saved `cwd`.

### `/new`

Start a fresh session without closing the one you're in.

### `/mux-new <path>`

Start a fresh session in a different working directory (equivalent to `/new`, but for another folder).

### `/fork`

Fork your current session at any previous message, the original stays open.

### `/mux`

Lists every Pi running on your machine. Press Enter to jump to an open Pi or bring a backgrounded one forward; kill the ones you're done with.

Each row shows cwd, session name, and a tag:

- `[current]` — the Pi you're typing in.
- `[backgrounded]` — parked in `_pi-mux`, brought back via `/switch`.
- `[open]` — running in another tmux pane you can navigate to.
- `[... · busy]` if mid-turn.

### `/mux-status`

Print whether pi-mux is active in the current Pi session.

## How it works

pi-mux keeps one extra tmux session, `_pi-mux`, holding backgrounded Pis as detached windows. Spawning (`/new`, `/fork`, `/switch` to a non-live session) creates a detached window in the pool, starts Pi there, and swaps its pane into your visible pane. The Pi you just left is now in the pool, still running.

```
tmux
├── your session
│   └── visible pane  ←── pi-mux swaps panes in & out
│
└── _pi-mux            (hidden, auto-managed)
    ├── window: Pi session A
    ├── window: Pi session B
    └── window: Pi session C
```

When a Pi exits, its window closes; tmux auto-destroys the pool when empty. Heartbeat files in `~/.pi-mux/heartbeats/` track each live Pi, so `/switch` and `/mux` can show which sessions are alive and which are busy.

Backgrounded Pis idle at ~0% CPU and use memory equivalent to one Pi session each.

> [!TIP]
> Hide `_pi-mux` from `tmux ls` with: `alias tls="tmux ls 2>/dev/null | grep -v '^_pi-mux:'"`.
> If the pool has leftover windows after a crash, run `tmux kill-session -t _pi-mux` to clear.
